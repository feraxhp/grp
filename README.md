## Configuration

The grp configurations are store in json. the first time you run
grp, it will create the configurations file with the base config.

if you prefer a gide configuration use: `grp config add`

the location of the config folder depends on the platform
- linux: `$HOME/.config/girep/config.json`
- windows `%appdata%/girep/config.json`
- mac: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/girep/config.json`

the basic structure looks like this:
```json
{
  "default": "",
  "pconf": []
}
```

grp manage the platforms in objets called pcofs. in every pconf you have to add

- **name**: Is the name for the pconf, it is used to determine the platform. 
- **owner**: Is the username that will use by default to request in the platform.
- **token**: Is a user generated token used to authenticate the request.
- **type**: type of the platform. currently allows `github`, `gitea`.
- **endpoint**: the endpoint to make the request 
  - examples:
    - `"api.github.com"`: for GitHub.
    - `"gitea.com"`: for Gitea.
    - `"tea.example.com"`: for Gitea on custom host.
    - `localhost:3244`: for gitea on localhost.

here is an example for a complete config file:

```json
{
  "default": "gh",
  "pconf": [
      {
      "name": "gh",
      "owner": "feraxhp",
      "token": "<token generated>",
      "type": "github",
      "endpoint": "api.github.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "tea",
      "owner": "feraxhp",
      "token": "<token generated>",
      "type": "gitea",
      "endpoint": "tea.example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```
