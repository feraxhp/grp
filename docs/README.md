Is a command line tool that helps you manage your git repositories in the cloud, for difrent platforms. 
It is written in Rust, and it is inspired by [gcli](https://github.com/herrhotzenplotz/gcli).

## Future of girep

__girep__ was designed to help me mannage my git platform authentication tokens, 
not only in various devices, but as simple as posible. It also becomes an abstraction for 
all the difrent platforms API. 

The basic implementation is already done, but my goal is to add more functionality in the future. 
related to the API's themselfs, to be able to create issues, pull request... etc.
